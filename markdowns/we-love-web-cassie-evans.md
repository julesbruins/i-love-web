GSAP = animations library. 

the library can be intimidating at the start. 
We’re going through the things that cassie thinks that could be usefull.
￼

with GSAP u use timelines. 
U can also use a lot of scroll animations.

GSAP is like a toolbox that is full of everything u need. It is tempting to only use the things u know. GSAP is very big on performance.

utils is what cassie also very likes. Some examples are utils.random(), utils.wrap() or utils.mapRange(). 

animations exist of math and “stuff” is what she calls it.

!!! let the ease do the work 
start with exploring different kind of stuff of easing.

other usefull stuff: matchMedia().

helper functions when thing are to big, they have a help in the library to make that bigger animation.
